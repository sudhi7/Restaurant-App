# Serve Clever

An application built out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that enables hotels and waiters to manage the orders made by the customers. This application uses an API to fetch that data of the food items in the menu. The food items can be searched in the menu based on the name and its category. The tables can also be searched based on the table number. The food items can be added to a particular table using a drag and drop feature. Once the item is dropped, the total cost of the table is also updated. The App uses session storage to store the table information.
